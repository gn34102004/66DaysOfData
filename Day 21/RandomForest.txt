Hi Everyone 

Day 21 of #66DaysOfData challenge

Today I had learnt about Random Forest

It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses bagging to train the decision trees. Bagging, also known as Bootstrap Aggregation, involves organizing original data into samples called Bootstrap Samples. 

Random forests are used for classification, regression. For classification through majority vote it gives output, and for regression output is calculated through mean, median.

Due to the multiple Decision Tree the model from Low Bias and High Variance gets converted to Low Variance which decreases the Error rate, and increases the Accuracy.
