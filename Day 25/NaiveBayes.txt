Hi Everyone

Day 25 of #66DaysOfData challenge

Today I had learnt about Naive Bayes algorithm

It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses Bayes' probability theory to solve classification problems. The Naive Bayes algorithm can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.



The Naive Bayes algorithm works by:

1) Calculating the prior probability for each class label

2) Finding the likelihood probability for each attribute for each class label

3) Calculating the posterior probability using the Bayes formula

4) Classifying based on the highest probability
