Hi Everyone,

Day 10 of #66DaysOfData challenge

Today I have learnt about P Value and Hypothesis Testing.

1) P Value - It is a probability for the "Null Hypothesis" to be true.

It is also known as Significance Value and denoted by Î±(alpha).

-> Null Hypothesis - It treats everything same or equal.

-> Alternate Hypothesis - There is a difference.

2) Hypothesis Testing - Depending on P value the Hypothesis Testing is done in several dataset. If P<=0.05 the Null Hypothesis is rejected and Alternate Hypothesis becomes True for the datasets.

-> One Sample Proportion Test - If only One Categorical Feature is there.

-> Chi Square Test - Two Categorical Feature is there.

-> T Test - One Continous Variable along with Categorical Feature.

-> Correlation - Two Continous Variable are present.

-> Anova Test - If there is Continous Variable and a Categorical Variable present in which, the Categorical Variable must have more than Two Features.
