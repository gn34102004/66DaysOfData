Hi Everyone

Day 27 of #66DaysOfData challenge

Today I had learnt about k-nearest neighbors (KNN)

It is a supervised learning classifier that uses proximity to make predictions or classifications about the grouping of a data point.

The work of algorithm:

1) Select the number of neighbors, K.

2) Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors.

3) Use a majority vote to determine which class a new observation should fall into.
