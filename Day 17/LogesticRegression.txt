Hi Everyone

Day 17 of #66DaysOfData challenge

Today I have learnt about "Logestic Regression" from Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

-> Logestic Regression- It accomplishes Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification tasks by predicting the probability of an outcome, event, or observation. 

- It is usually applied to a problem statement where these two classification problem is Linearly Separable. 

- The Cost Function/Optimizer must be Maximum to be classified correctly.

- By the use of Sigmoid Function, it removes the affect og the outlier.
