Hi Everyone,

Day 7 of my #66DaysOfData challenge 

Today I have learnt about Linear Regression.

It is one of the algorithm which comes under Supervised Learning. It provides relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events.

Best Fit line- The line that tries to minimize the error(distance) between y^(the points which you find on best fit line) and y(actual points). 

The formula is y = mx + c



Convergence Theorem- The Î±(alpha) value must be vey small otherwise it wouldn't reach the Global minimum and keep bouncing.
