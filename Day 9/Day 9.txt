Hi Everyone,

Day 9 of #66DayOfData challenge 

Today I have studied the concept of 

1) R^2 and Adjusted R^2

-> R^2 : It is used to check the goodness of the best fit line. The value of R^2 increases with the increase of independent feature. If the value is <0 then it is worser than the average best fit line.

-> Adjusted R^2 : It penalizes attribute that are not correlated which makes the value to Decrease. If the attribute is correlated the value of adjusted R^2 increases(0 to 1), which is good for best fit line.

2) Bias and variance

-> Bias : Error of the training data.

-> Variance : Error of the testing data.

High Bias, High Variance = Underfitting

Low Bias, High Variance = Overfitting

Low Bias, Low Variance = Generalized Model
