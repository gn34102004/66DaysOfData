Hi Everyone

Day 11 of #66DaysofData challenge

Today I have studied the concept of 

-> Variance - is a measure of how data points vary from the mean,

-> Standard Deviation - It is the square root of the variance.

-> Covariance - It measures the total variation of two random variables from their expected values. The drawback is it can only measure the directional relationship between two variables, and can't measure the strength.

-> Pearson Correlation Coefficient - It is the most common way of measuring a linear correlation. It can measure strength along with the direction of relationship. The valur ranges from [-1,1]. 

-> Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient - It is the same as Pearson, but as it calculate with the outliers certain condition must be followed. 

- We are supposed to sort out the two column in ascending order.

- Next we need to add two more column by ranking them. 

- In next column comes the difference in the rank of the two column created.

- The last column is the square of the difference of the rank, which is the di^2.
